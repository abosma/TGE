# TGE - Typescript Game Engine

A simple typescript game engine modeled off the Component based game engine type.

Not to be used in any capacity except by me for fun.

## Running the engine

To run, install the packages with ```npm install``` and run ```npm run dev```. This will open a browser together with ESBuild running in the background updating whenever any typescript file is changed.

For level files and config files it's required to do a manual page refresh.
